## Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of Bitcoin (BTC) compared to the S&P 500 index throughout 2021. The primary goal was to evaluate Bitcoin as a potential addition to a traditional investment portfolio, with a focus on the trade-off between Risk (Volatility) and Reward (Upside Potential).

## File Description
File Name: Bitcoin-SP500-2021-Analysis.xlsx

## Tools Used
Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, Advanced Charting, Data Cleaning, Statistical Functions).

## Key Findings
- **High Growth Potential**: Bitcoin delivered a 39.23% total return in 2021, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 26.60%.
- **Volatility Risk**: Bitcoin exhibited extreme price swings, while the S&P 500 maintained relative stability.
- **Strategic Verdict**: Bitcoin can serve as a powerful growth supplement for portfolios with high risk tolerance, but it is not suitable as a standalone safe-haven asset.
